# MyKeyGenerator

MyKeyGenerator is a Java program that allows you to generate encryption keys using the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). With this program, you can generate both AES and RSA keys of various sizes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hossein-sa/MyKeyGenerator.git
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile and run the MyKeyGenerator class.

## Features
   - Generates AES keys of 128-bit or 256-bit size.
   - Generates RSA key pairs of 512-bit, 1024-bit, 2048-bit, or 4086-bit size.
   - Simple command-line interface for user interaction.
    
## Dependencies
   - Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)
